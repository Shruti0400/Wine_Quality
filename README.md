# Wine Quality Analysis

#### About the Project

This project explores wine quality data to identify key chemical properties influencing wine ratings. By applying machine learning and statistical analysis, the study aims to predict wine quality and provide insights into optimizing wine composition for improved taste and market competitiveness.

#### About the Dataset
The dataset includes physicochemical properties of wine samples, such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, and alcohol content, along with corresponding quality ratings (scored from 0 to 10).

#### Key Objectives

- Determine the most influential factors affecting wine quality.
- Develop predictive models to classify wine quality levels.
- Assist winemakers in optimizing wine formulations for better taste and consumer preference.

#### Key Features of the Dataset

- Acidity (Fixed, Volatile, Citric Acid) – Affects taste balance.

- Residual Sugar – Influences sweetness and mouthfeel.

- Chlorides, Sulfates – Indicators of saltiness and preservation potential.

- Alcohol Content – Correlates with wine quality and flavor complexity.

- Wine Quality Score – The target variable, rated from 0 to 10.

#### Business Strategies & Insights

- Quality Enhancement – Optimize acidity, sugar, and alcohol levels for superior wine production.
- Process Optimization – Improve efficiency by focusing on key factors that influence quality ratings.
- Market Differentiation – Position wines based on quality segments to attract diverse consumer groups.

#### Tools & Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas – Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.

- Scikit-learn – Machine learning for predictive modeling.

- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization for trend identification.

#### Key Findings & Data-Driven Decisions
- Alcohol content and volatile acidity are the strongest predictors of wine quality.
- Wines with balanced acidity and moderate sugar levels receive higher ratings.
- Machine learning models achieved 85%+ accuracy in predicting wine quality, aiding data-driven production improvements.

#### Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into wine quality assessment, helping winemakers refine production processes, improve quality control, and enhance customer satisfaction through data-driven decision-making.
